# NeMo Branch of MSULinguisticsCapstone

This branch was used for experimenting with NeMo for our Project

https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/index.html

Nemo had some advantages over just using Hugging Face including:

1. Faster and Easier ASR deployment out of the box
2. Language Modeling that worked really well

However it was scraped due to the following reasons:

1. Cross OS Portability was a big issue especially with the LM's
2. Installation deemed to be too complex for the intended user
